## Colocation File System Architecture

This project follows a **colocation-based architecture** each feature keeps its own pages, components, and logic inside its route folder.  
Shared UI, hooks, and configuration live at the top level, making the codebase modular, scalable, and easier to maintain as the app grows.

For a full breakdown of the structure with examples, see the [Next Colocation Template](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-colocation-template).
